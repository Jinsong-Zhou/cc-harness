**Multi-agent harness framework for long-running application development with Claude Code.**

Based on Anthropic's research: [Harness Design for Long-Running Application Development](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps)

---

## Why This Exists

Single-agent approaches to complex coding tasks produce superficially impressive but often **broken** results. Two persistent problems:

1. **Self-evaluation bias** — Models confidently praise their own mediocre work. Separating creation from evaluation is the strongest lever for quality.
2. **Context deterioration** — Models lose coherence over long sessions. Structured handoffs and context management keep multi-hour builds on track.

This plugin implements a **generator-evaluator architecture** (inspired by GANs) that drives real quality through iterative feedback loops.

## Components

### Agents

| Agent | Model | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| `harness-planner` | Opus | Read-only | Converts 1-4 sentence prompts into ambitious product specs |
| `harness-generator` | Opus | Full write | Builds features iteratively with git commits |
| `harness-evaluator` | Opus | Read + Bash | Skeptical QA — tests live apps via Playwright/browser |

### Skills

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `harness-loop` | Building complex apps autonomously | Orchestrates the full planner → generator → evaluator loop |
| `context-management` | Long sessions approaching limits | Strategies for compaction vs resets, structured handoffs |
| `harness-tuning` | Optimizing harness performance | Evaluator calibration, component removal, prompt engineering |

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/harness <prompt>` | Start a harnessed development session |
| `/evaluate [scope]` | Trigger standalone evaluation |
| `/harness-status` | Show session progress and scores |

### Rules

Always-loaded prescriptive guidelines:
- **harness-workflow** — Mandatory pipeline for complex builds
- **evaluator-discipline** — Skepticism over politeness in QA
- **context-strategy** — When and how to manage context
- **file-communication** — Protocol for inter-agent file communication

### Hooks

| Event | Profile | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `SessionStart` | minimal+ | Initialize or restore harness state |
| `PreCompact` | minimal+ | Save state before context compaction |
| `PostToolUse` | standard+ | Track file edits for iteration logging |
| `Stop` | minimal+ | Write session summary with metrics |

**Hook profiles:** Control verbosity via `CC_HARNESS_PROFILE` env var:
- `minimal` — State persistence only
- `standard` (default) — State + iteration tracking
- `strict` — All hooks including verbose logging

## Grading Criteria

### Full-Stack Applications

| Criterion | Weight | Measures |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Product Depth | HIGH | Real functionality vs facades — can users complete workflows? |
| Functionality | HIGH | Does it actually work? Bugs, edge cases, error states? |
| Visual Design | MEDIUM | Polished, consistent, full-viewport UI with coherent identity |
| Code Quality | LOW | Competence check — broken fundamentals only |

### Frontend Design

| Criterion | Weight | Measures |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Design Quality | HIGH | Coherent whole vs collection of parts — mood and identity |
| Originality | HIGH | Custom decisions vs AI patterns / template defaults |
| Craft | MEDIUM | Typography, spacing, color harmony, contrast |
| Functionality | MEDIUM | Usability independent of aesthetics |

## File-Based Communication

Agents communicate through files in `harness/`, not conversation context:

```
harness/
├── sprint-contract.md       # Generator → Evaluator: what "done" means
├── sprint-result.md         # Generator → Evaluator: what was built
├── qa-feedback.md           # Evaluator → Generator: grades + issues
├── iteration-log.md         # Running log of all iterations
├── context-handoff.md       # Structured state for context resets
└── .harness-state.json      # Machine-readable session metrics
```

## Cost Reference

| Approach | Duration | Cost | Quality |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| Solo agent (no harness) | ~20 min | ~$9 | Broken core features |
| Full harness (with sprints) | ~6 hours | ~$200 | Working, polished |
| Simplified harness (no sprints) | ~4 hours | ~$125 | Working, comparable |

> The full harness costs ~20x more than solo but produces **actually working** applications.

## Adapting to New Models

Every harness component encodes an assumption about model limitations. Use the `harness-tuning` skill to systematically audit which components are still load-bearing:

| Component | Status with Opus 4.6 |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Planner | **Keep** — models don't naturally expand scope ambitiously |
| Evaluator | **Keep** — self-evaluation bias persists across all versions |
| Sprint decomposition | **Removed** — model maintains coherence over 2+ hour builds |
| Context resets | **Removed** — no context anxiety in recent models |
